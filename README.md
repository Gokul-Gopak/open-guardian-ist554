# Open Guardian Solutions

This repository outlines the expansion strategy of OpenGuardian Solutions, a rapidly growing IT company, into North America. The focus of the expansion is to establish new production facilities and offices in key regions including Canada, Mexico, and the United States. The plan includes at least one new office/facility in each of Canada and Mexico, as well as two new offices/facilities within the U.S. This repository will document the strategic, operational, and logistical steps necessary for scaling the company’s footprint, providing insights into market research, site selection, legal considerations, resource allocation, and projected growth. The expansion aims to strengthen OpenGuardian’s presence and support its mission to empower organizations with advanced cybersecurity and automation solutions across North America.
